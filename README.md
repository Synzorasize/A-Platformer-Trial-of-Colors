# A-Platformer-Trial-of-Colors
This is source code for my first game. This project has to be imported into Godot in order for it to work. This is the website for my game:

This is All Rights Reserved, so you can only look at the code, but you can also download it and play with it. You can also learn something from the files, too, but don't release it without giving me credit!
